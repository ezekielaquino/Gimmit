# Gimmit

`git commit` but cuter âœ¨

## What it does

`Gimmit` is nothing more than tiny little opinionated terminal prompt to hopefully make mundane commit messages a bit more joyful (or more meaningful, if you want).

You'd still use your regular `git` commands, you can just use `gimmit` instead of your everyday `git commit`.

See below ðŸŒ…

*Opinionated? Whuuu?*
The emojis are curated by yours truly. There is a "Random" commit that selects from a pool of curatedâ„¢ gimmit emojis ðŸ˜˜

## How to install

Simply install globally via `npm instal -g gimmit` or `yarn global add gimmit`.

Once installed, You can now simply type `gimmit` when you want to make a commit to your repo and just follow the prompts.

## Plans

- Override configuration and customize the selects via a .gimmitconfig
- Add the possibility for validations for commit messages

### P.S.
Peace and love ðŸ’–
