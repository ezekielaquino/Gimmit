# Gimmit

`git commit` but cuter âœ¨

## What it does

Gimmit is `not` a full CLI; what it is is an opinionated terminal prompt to hopefully make mundane commit messages a bit more joyful (or more meaningful, if you want). See below.

*Opinionated? Whuuu?*
The emojis are curated by yours truly. There is a "Random" commit that selects from a pool of curatedâ„¢ gimmit emojis ðŸ˜˜

## How to install

Simply install globally via `npm instal -g gimmit` or `yarn global add gimmit`. Once installed, You can now simply type `gimmit` when you want to make a commit to your repo and just follow the prompts.

Peace and love ðŸ’–
