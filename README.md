# Gimmit

`git commit` but cuter ‚ú®

## What it does

`Gimmit` is nothing more than tiny little opinionated terminal prompt to hopefully make mundane commit messages a bit more joyful (or more meaningful, if you want).

You'd still use your regular `git` commands, you can just use `gimmit` instead of your everyday `git commit`.

See below üåÖ

*Opinionated? Whuuu?*
The emojis are curated by yours truly. There is a "Random" commit that selects from a pool of curated‚Ñ¢ gimmit emojis üòò

## How to install

Assuming you already have `git` cli installed on your machine: simply install globally via `npm instal -g gimmit` or `yarn global add gimmit`.

Once installed, You can now simply type `gimmit` when you want to make a commit to your repo and just follow the prompts.

## Custom configuration

Just make a `.gimmitrc.json` in your root directory.

You can pass in your own options for both `commit flavors` and the `pool` of emoji the random function selects from.

*Note:* The random option is always the first option even though you pass in your own set.

```json
// .gimmitrc.json
{
  "options": [
    {
      "label": "Custom option",
      "emoji": "ü¶Ñ"
    }
  ],
  "emojiPool": [
    "üêô",
    "üåª"
  ]
}
```

You can have fun with this! You can replace the `emoji` with anything: say, you want to have consistent "labeled" commits in your team, or just for yourself, then you can do something like:

```json
// .gimmitrc.json
{
  "options": [
    {
      "label": "Visual Design",
      "emoji": "[VISUAL]"
    }, {
      "label": "Final final",
      "emoji": "[FINALFINALv3]",
    }
  ],
  "emojiPool": [
    "[I ATE BANANA]",
    "[GIMME BURGER]"
  ]
}
```

Have fun!

## Plans

- [x] Override configuration and customize the selects via a .gimmitconfig
- [ ] Add the possibility for validations for commit messages
